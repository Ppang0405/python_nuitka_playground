# Research on Python to Single Executable Compilation and Docker Distribution

This research explores the process of compiling Python programs into single executable files using [Nuitka](https://nuitka.net/) and distributing them efficiently via Docker containers. The goal is to create self-contained applications that are easier to deploy and manage, while also considering aspects of code obfuscation.

## Nuitka: Compiling Python to Executables

Nuitka is a Python compiler that translates Python code into C source code, which is then compiled into a native executable. This process offers several advantages:

*   **Performance Improvement:** Compiled code can often run faster than interpreted Python.
*   **Code Obfuscation:** By converting Python source into a binary, Nuitka helps in obfuscating the original source code, making it harder to reverse-engineer. This is particularly useful for on-premise deployments where source code protection is a concern, as highlighted in the article "Python code obfuscation using Nuitka" by Varun B Patil[^1].
*   **Standalone Distribution:** Nuitka can bundle all necessary Python modules, libraries, and dependencies into a single executable file (using the `--onefile` option) or a standalone directory (using `--standalone`). This eliminates the need for a Python interpreter on the target machine, simplifying deployment.

## Docker for Distribution

Once a Python application is compiled into a single executable, Docker can be leveraged for streamlined distribution. A Docker image can be built to contain the Nuitka-compiled binary, along with any other required runtime dependencies. This approach ensures consistent execution environments across different deployment targets and simplifies scaling.

### Benefits of Dockerized Distribution:

*   **Portability:** Docker containers encapsulate the application and its environment, ensuring it runs consistently everywhere.
*   **Isolation:** Applications run in isolated environments, preventing conflicts with other software on the host system.
*   **Simplified Deployment:** Deploying a Docker image is often simpler and faster than manually setting up dependencies and environments.

## Research Focus

This research investigates the practical steps, challenges, and benefits of combining Nuitka's compilation capabilities with Docker's containerization for Python application deployment. It explores how to:

*   Effectively use Nuitka's compilation options (`--standalone`, `--onefile`).
*   Integrate the Nuitka compilation process into a Dockerfile.
*   Optimize Docker images for size and performance with compiled Python applications.
